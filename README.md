# Snake-game
Hello users!
This is my first project that I created without any outside help 

Snake movement follows standard command of wasd
W -> up
A -> left
S -> down 
D -> right 
Snake only dies if it bites its own body
Snake appears from other side if it crosses the boundry 

Thanks For PlayingğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„
Open to suggestion on way of improving my code
